# Importing a Solana Project into Solana Playground

This guide shows you how to import your Solana project into the [Solana Playground](https://beta.solpg.io) from GitHub.

## Steps

1. **Go to Solana Playground**
   - Open [https://beta.solpg.io](https://beta.solpg.io) in your browser.

2.1 **Import from GitHub**
   - Click "New Project" and choose "Import from GitHub."
   - Paste your GitHub repo URL (e.g., `https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject`).
   - If your project is in a subfolder, add the path (e.g., `https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject/tree/main/myproject`).
   - Click "Import" to load it.
  
2.2 **Import from local files**
   - Drag local files to import options.

4. **Check It Worked**
   - Once imported, you can edit, build, and test your project in the Playground.
   - If it fails, double-check your URL or project setup.

## Tips
- Your GitHub repo should be public (private might need extra steps).
- The Playground uses devnet by default for testing.
